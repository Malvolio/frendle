            Welcome to Frendle! Our community thrives when everyone feels valued,

            consideration.

          <p className="leading-relaxed">
            We also understand that some folks may need reminding, especially online, on how to interact with others. So we've put these house rules together to keep all of us accountable to each other and make sure that Frendle stays a welcoming space.

              perspectives, and stories. Approach conversations with genuine
              curiosity rather than judgment. You might discover that someone
              who seems different from you shares unexpected common ground, or
              that their different viewpoint enriches your own understanding.

              Kindness is the foundation of every meaningful connection. Even
              when you don't click with someone or find yourself in
              disagreement, you can still interact with respect and
              consideration. Remember that behind every profile is a real person
              with feelings, hopes, and perhaps some vulnerability in reaching
              out for friendship.

                rejection isn't personalâ€”it's just about compatibility.
